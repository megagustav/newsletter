		<p>This preliminary research stems from reading articles on mnemonic devices and work rituals with the goal of extracting practical semantics for everyday people for <i>function</i>, <i>ritual</i> and <i>myth</i>.</p>
		<p>The first stage was to collect words that fit in these three categories. At a later stage, we can combine each column into a comprehensive definition and establish a functioning cognitive model.</p>
