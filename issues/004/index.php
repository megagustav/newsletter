        <h4>January 5th, 2020</h4>
      </div>

<p>The last PowerPC laptops were released in late October 2005. The next Mac laptop would be my first Mac: The 2006 white polycarbonate MacBook. It still ran Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger", a few months later I would giddily buy Leopard for 129€, loan the installer DVD to friends after I was done. It was an Intel machine, the first generation of Macs that could relably boot into Windows! I distinctly remember a friend's comment that his dad would now forever hold on to his G5 iMac — the last true Mac! He would never buy an Intel machine. A few months later his son would join me in the white MacBook club, soon thereafter another friend had the same machine. They already had the Core 2 Duo models, I was on the first-generation base-model Core Duo. This laptop had a built in iSight webcam. The lid was held shut with magnets hidden in the body of the device, no button at the front to release a pin securing lid to body. Before this computer, I was using a Dell hand-me-down from my dad. We're already on an alternate timeline in this essay so I'm not sure how to put it into the right techno-historical context. The machine did not have Wifi built-in. We didn't have Wifi at home. Later, when we did, I got a PCIe card for the laptop but my room was too far from the router. Not a problem for the MacBook! I don't know when I installed the first third-party programs on the machine, I was too busy exploring the bundled software. I remember little utilities like iAlertU, SMC Fan Control and iStat Menu. Of course, iWork had to be purchased seperately and the updated iLife suite was a paid upgrade too. Handbrake got a lot of use. I had a super tidy iTunes library...

Start with my first Mac...

My next computer was the 2009 unibody MacBook Pro. I always admired my uncle's aluminium PowerBook. A metal computer! Super nice! My plastic MacBook was already desintegrating, a common issue in that first generation. His laptop was banged up but beautiful. The MacBook Pros were my north star. One day I would need something that powerful! My friend had a 15" MacBook Pro, I only had a MacBook, sans Pro. When the unibody machines came out, I think I looked at images of that laptop daily. That black glass bezel, the sleep light etched into the body. Wow! My beloved and desintegrating MacBook finally had some display problems that first led to a prolonged dying process through an external monitor bridging the gap between broken laptop and functioning desktop. So after three years of demanding service, it was retired. I configured this MacBook Pro! Maxed out most of the specs! The old MacBook was pretty slow and the broken display didn't help. I thought going all out on the specs would prolong the life of my second Mac. I'm sure the initial spec helped out of the box, and I would later upgrade the RAM, install first one then two SSDs, replace the fans, the battery (twice!), the trackpad, the rubber feet and the baseplate screws. That machine got me through high school and university. In the summer of 2018, after 9 years of duty, I replaced it with a slimmer, lighter, faster, space-greyer, higher-resolution, higher-priced, lower-upgradability 13.3" MacBook Pro. I loved the MacBook, I longed for the PowerBook, the MacBook Pro, I loved that MacBook Pro. I used and abused that device. It reminds me of my uncle's PowerBook. Beaten but proud. My friend's sister once walked over it with the lid closed! Things broke, but I was able to mend them. I upgraded what I could. Sure, a retina screen would be nice and I was stuck on a version of macOS from 2016 because later systems would not run. But everything else, I had: a great backlit keyboard, a large screen, a multi-touch trackpad, ports, ports, ports, acceptable battery life. It was a heavy beast and I was getting tired lugging it along. I was now travelling more. I really enjoy the new small laptop, but it's different. I have a keyboard of questionable reliability, I need adapters, I have Wifi problems. it's a black box. I can't repair, replace or upgrade anything. I doubt this machine will last 9 years like the old one.

On my hunt for old iPods (an ongoing <a href="https://moor.house/ipod">side-project</a>) I got my hands on a pristine-conditition 2003 iPod. The one with the four buttons below the screen. That design didn't last long and was probably the least-usable iPod. A pretty obscure device. Who remembers it? I certainly do, and it made quite the impression on me. It was the first time I ever saw an iPod! I didn't know what it was, and once evening around a dinner with family and friends a kid showed me his walkman or something. It had these red glowing touch-sensitive buttons, and tons and tons of Linkin Park! Oh boy did I want one. But the iPod desire is a different story. So I find this iPod on eBay and pick it up. I get it for 15€. It doesn't turn on. I get all the accessories. I went to the guy's eBay listing for the even-obscurer headphone remote iPod accessory. It's hard to find and this guy had it, and gave me the iPod with it. That iPod launched a whole story. The reason I'm writing this. 

I remember that I once bricked my iPod. How did I reset it? Google didn't help much. "Did you mean <i><b>iPad not starting up</i></b>?" — nope. Finally, I found the answer: Hold <keyboard>select</keyboard> and <keyboard>menu</keyboard>, and connect the iPod to power using the original brick. How do I know the capacitive button is receiving my input? It didn't seem to be working. But I didn't have the original charging brick. What I received from the seller and what I had at home was a 30-pin to USB cable. That iPod still came with a 30-pin to FireWire 400 cable and a chunky 15W charger. I have the right cable somewhere at my parent's house, but it was easier to get something on eBay. So I finally have the right cable and lo and behold the dead iPod resurrects. It holds about 10 minutes of charge before dying. Since it has a 20GB hard drive, I can turn it into a pretty usable stationary music unit. I go out to get a USB-C to USB-A adapter and plug the iPod into my laptop. Surprisingly, the Finder (RIP iTunes) detects the iPod. It's full. Not with music, it was used as an external hard drive. I guess in 2003 a 20GB music library would have been a lot and why wouldn't you use it as a portable drive too? Ironically, indicentally, cosmic coincidentally it holds the portfolio of an industrial design student, and lots of design project files. I take a peak at the portfolio and see a 15-year younger version of the man I gave 15€ to a few days prior. How could would it be to return the files to him? Okay, maybe he has them backed up somewhere else but then again who had redundant backups in 2003? This idea of giving the seller back his old project files triggered the series of events that lead me to writing this. Why does the iPod die when connected to the Mac? Oh right, the iPod is too old for USB 2.0. One of the specs of USB 2.0 is that it can carry data AND power! USB 1.x only carries data. So I can connect the iPod, see its content, start copying the files across, but it'll die after 10 minutes. So how can I connect an iPod that doesn't know about USB 2.0, certainly not 3.0 type C? Maybe I can get a FireWire 400 to FireWire 800 adapter. My old MacBook Pro has a FireWire 800 port. But I don't have access to that computer. To bridge the gap between a USB 1.0 30-pin connector to Thunderbolt 3, I would need the following adapters: 30-pin to FireWire 400 (check), FireWire 400 to FireWire 800 (10€), FireWire 800 to Thunderbolt 2 (30€) and finally Thunderbolt 2 to Thunderbolt 3 (52€), and pray that in that chain there are no duds, that data as well as power gets carried through all connections... Is there a better way than to spend almost 100€ on dongles and being uncertain about the outcome?

The last 12" PowerBook G4 was released on October 19th 2005. It could hold 1.25GB of RAM! It was a beast in an understated chassis. It also sells for about 40€ on eBay nowadays and has a FireWire 400 port. 

<h2>The 2005 12" PowerBook G4 Review as it were released today</h2>

Overall impressions

While the laptop is thicker and heavier than most of its siblings or the competitor's offerings, thanks to it's compact built it's still surprisingly portable. The 4:3 form factor means it's narrower than other 12" laptops today. On such a small screen most of what I do is reading and writing, which are both areas where I welcome a taller rather than wider screen. Thumbs up for that change! In a landscape where laptop screens become <a href="https://media.nbb-cdn.de/images/products/350000/358663/Dell_XPS-13-9370_silber_hero.jpeg">wider</a> and <a href="https://assets2.razerzone.com/images/project-valerie/371f0cee96e61dad46e4161c87a3a720-projvalerie-gallery-1500x1000_2.png">wider</a>, the 12" PowerBook stands out tall and proud and tall. 

The 4:3 pushed me to be more focused on a single task. It makes it harder to have two windows side by side. The most multitasking I found myself doing was writing in BBEdit and keeping an eye on some Finder copy dialogs floating on the right.

Performance

Thanks to the SSD, the machine boots quickly. In a side by side test with my 2018 MacBook Pro, the PowerBook took 13.4 seconds and the MacBook 9.7. Where the performance really fell off was in web browsing. Safari is basically unusable in Tiger since most websites use bad JavaScript or other things that Tiger isn't expecting. Safari also does not seem to understand many server security certificates, even on sites adhering to golden web standards. The alternative browser I found, TenFourFox, a Firefox port for Tiger and other older macOSes, is very resource-intensive. 

Speaking of focus boots through performance impediments: In removal of the Messages app and as such the inability to receive and send iMessages works wonders. Coupled with slow web-performance, distraction is limited only to the selection of music in iTunes. 

The 1GB RAM stick I received when ordering upgrade parts was faulty and was only showing as 512MB, as such I'm running 768 MB of DDR SDRAM. As of this writing, I'm waiting for a reply from the bookshop (link). The processor is the top-of-the-line single-core 1.5 GHz PowerPC G4 with 512 KB of L2 cache. It would have been nice to see a laptop version of the G5, but for various reasons that never happened. Instead, we got the Intel transition. Combined with Tiger's ability to boot into Classic Mac OS, this is the best laptop to natively experience software from 20 years ago.

FEWER TANGENTS

Industrial Design

Upon reassembly of the laptop, I tried bending the top case back into shape but it needs a future, more patient me to do a better job at it. The device seems to have suffered an impressive fall on its bottom left corner, which not only bent the aluminium chassis and snapped off parts of the dark grey plastic frame but also split open the battery. I can tell it was superglued back together and I do worry about the heat coming from the battery. But I'm sure that's normal. 

The insides are a mess. My 2009 MacBook Pro was logically organised, its unibody chassis providing the right fit. Internal symmetry was as important to the design team as what was visible from the outside. Not so for the PowerBook. I would be surprised if the design team had much say on how things should look under the covers. Sticky tape, hand-written notes, screws of various diameters, lengths, colors, orientations, there's a lot going on inside. I was able to replace the dried old thermal paste but found one of the spring-loaded screws fixing the heatsink to the CPU immovable and superglued into place. I had to brake it off and decided against superglueing it again.

The plastic frame around the PowerBook was inherited by the first generation of MacBook Pros, before they went unibody. In the screen lid, the plastic hides the wifi antennas. There's also a <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2011/08/14/photos-of-a-prototype-macbook-pro-with-integrated-3g-cellular-data/">prototype MacBook Pro</a> with a magnetically-removeable antenna for cellular connectivity.

Input
The new PowerBooks feature a new trackpad gesture: Two-finger scrolling
the trackpad has been decreased. There were complaints that the trackpads on the MacBooks (and Pros) got too big for their good and just led to accidental input. That risk has been mitigated in the PowerBook. 

Miscellaneous
“Ignore accidental trackpad input” is off by default. In previous versions of Tiger this was on and lead to more intentional input ignored than accidental input mitigated.

I don't love the thick bezels of the Finder Windows

Windows are only resizeable in the bottom right corner. I preferred and got used to the windows being resizeable everywhere.

Conclusion
But for 40€ there was a lot to learn from

Apple also did away with the Touchbar and instead returned to the classic function keys we know from previous keyboards as well as their external Magic Keyboards. While the 12" lacks backlit the keyboard of its siblings, the letters in the keys are translucent so a savvy user could add some LEDs later.

Apple clearly listened to the criticism of their butterfly keyboard. The new PowerBook features many user-servicable parts:

Removeable battery. The user can carry a fully-charged second battery and replace it in a pinch.

A door at the bottom of the device holds the RAM. Unlike it's bigger 16" brother which is configurable up to 64 GB, the 12" PowerBook can hold a maximum of 1GB with an additional four 64 <b>Mega</b>-Bytes chips soldered to the motherboard for a total of 1.25 GB.

The wifi module, the AirPort Express card, is accessible behind the battery. You can order this machine without the card to save a few bucks.

Replaceable keyboard. My machine came with a German layout but I replaced it with the UK counterpart. 

The hard drive isn't easy to get to and required you to remove the keyboard and work your way down. Once inside, it's a standard 44-pin drive. I replaced my spinning drive with a 60GB mSATA SSD.



Cloning the iPod hard drive.

emailing the guy the link and his reply. 

another slight design tweak that you don't notice while using the machine is that the Apple logo is now illuminated and about 20% larger than on the mirror-finish logos of the MacBooks. this makes the PowerBook appear even smaller still. 

the bezels around the display have shrunken. 

i for one welcome the absence of the FaceTime camera. front-facing camera. webcam. no need to have a debate about tape.

<p>Take this email from my university, asking to cast my vote in electing the Alumni of the Year:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Instructions of how to cast your vote, along with a full nomination outline of each finalist, can be found in the Alumni of the Year Award section on our website. Please visit this page to cast your vote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, so I go to the website. I realise that I already am at Step 3, since being on the alumni mailing list qualifies me for Step 2, and having read the newsletter introduced me to the finalists. But Step 3 requires sending an email. I have to leave my email to go to a website to be instructed to send an email in a robot-friendly format?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mind the occasional email from my Alma Mater, swiping left to archive the message requires less effort than looking for the <em>unsubscribe</em> link, but I finally gathered the required effort to stop these messages, in the name of <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/merlinmann/inbox-zero-actionbased-email">Inbox Zero</a>.</p>

<p>So I scroll down to the footer and find, well laid out, in readable contrast, the familiar underlined text: The Unsubscribe Link.</p>

<p>Clicking the link opens a webpage with instructions to send an email with the subject <em>unsubscribe</em> to a specific address and include my full name in the body. This is basically <em>my</em> current subscription management system — primitive, and excusable for a one-man-show, but for an institution? Anyway, I send the email in the required robo-format. A few moments later, I receive this reply:</p>

<p>Horizontal scrolling is appropriate for displaying items within a same category: an image slideshow, Airbnb experiences, shows on Netflix or albums on Spotify&hellip; Horizontal scrolling, frowned upon before touchscreens, is the norm for such lists.  Exploring the Netflix catalogue can easily turn into 20 minutes of swiping, but sideways scrolling helps compartmentalise content, you know everything in the horizontal list belongs together.</p>

<p>Horizontal scrolling, independent of display sizes, offers consistency of interaction between devices. A larger screen will merely show more items in the list, but will also eventually cut off content. It also offers vertical consistency across panels. The horizontal scroll gets a designated section and stays in line with other elements on the page.</p>

<p>But this interaction has some severe <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/make-it-easy-on-the-user-designing-for-discoverability-within-mobile-apps">discoverablity</a> problems. How quickly can you find movies on baseball?</p>

<p>This list is ordered alphabetically and you knew to look for a Sports category even if it isn&rsquo;t immediately visible on screen. A predictable sorting pattern points you in the right direction in such a large menu and affordances such as a shadow that fades out elements on the outer edge of the container, or a half-cut-off element indicate that there&rsquo;s more.</p>

<p>If the list isn&rsquo;t movie categories but pages on a website with more disconnect in-between, an alphabetic sorting becomes counterproductive. We need to arrange essential elements at the start of the list to guarantee their visibility and move less commonly used features to the far end of the list.</p>

<p>Katie Sherwin, Senior UX Specialist with Norman Nielsen Group, <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/horizontal-scrolling/">warns us</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because horizontal scrolling is a lot less common on desktops, users often have no idea that they can discover content by “swiping” on large screens. Since people interact with mobile and desktop devices differently, the one-size-fits-all approach can backfire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Katie continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using a scrollbar on the desktop has a high interaction cost and slows people down. In a recent user test, a participant [&hellip;] complained, “<em>It’s taking me forever to scroll through this.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing just how much more there is and if or when the list repeats isn&rsquo;t obvious. A scroll bar is an appropriate indicator of the dimension of content within a container, but under iOS and macOS, the scroll bar is often hidden and we have no information on the amount of content without tentatively scrolling to reveal the indicator.</p>

<p>The content people are reading has to be in the immediate vicinity of the interaction element required to navigate the content layer. The object and its tool have to be connected, or the user might not even notice the obvious visual cues of more available content outside of the visible container.</p>

<p>On touchscreens, content can also act as the navigational tool, on desktop we need to adapt. Touchscreens taught us that horizontal scrolling <a href="https://uxplanet.org/horizontal-scrolling-in-mobile-643c81901af3">can be intuitive</a>, but translating it to the desktop has its challenges.</p>

<p>Alternatively, or additionally to the scrollbar a <em>item n of x</em> label would also help in understanding the information density. Merely having arrows or a fading scrollable array of categories doesn&rsquo;t communicate how many elements are left to be discovered.</p>

<p>Katie reminds us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tell people how much is left, so they can decide how much further to go. Or, in the case of a loop, users want to know when they’ve arrived back at the start.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do we show the list repeats or ends? Luke Wroblewski, Product Director at Google: <a href="https://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1945">Obvious always wins</a></p>

<p>A bounce at the end of a list communicates that there&rsquo;s nothing more to see. More spacing to the screen edge at beginning and end of a list than between list items helps define the borders of the content.</p>

<p>When a list repeats isn&rsquo;t very obvious in the case of Netflix. Their designers are undoubtedly aware of the compromises horizontal scrolling brings and we can only conclude that it&rsquo;s been done on purpose to maximise the length of our visits. There is a <a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org">certain kind of malice</a> to Netflix using the disadvantage an interaction has for the user to their benefit.</p>

<p>We can&rsquo;t just take the interactions we learnt from touchscreens and mirror them on desktop for mouse and keyboard. Just like we can&rsquo;t take a desktop OS and shrink it to work flawlessly on mobile. The two domains speak different languages and if copied word for word, the essence is lost in translation.</p>
